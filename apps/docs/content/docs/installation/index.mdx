## shadcn/ui

Setup can be done by using the shadcn/ui cli. You can find instructions for your framework [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation).

Next, install react-aria-components

```bash
npm install react-aria-components
```

## Router Provider

react-aria-components has its own Link component and API. This is used on various components in the library with href on them. To set this up for your projects
follow the instructions [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html#introduction).

This works on NextJS, React Router and Remix!

If you have to, you could switch out the link for your preferred one, but the above should handle most use cases.

Thats all!
